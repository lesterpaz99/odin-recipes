		<p>
			This is a super moist and tasty coconut cake. Growing up in Brazil, this
			was a favorite amongst our circle of friends. It is especially good with a
			cup of coffee on the side. I've converted a few of my anti-coconut family
			and friends into lovers of this cake.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>2 cups white sugar</li>
			<li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
			<li>4 eggs, separated</li>
			<li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
			<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps / Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 1:</h3>
				<p>
					Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake
					pan.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 2:</h3>
				<p>
					Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using an electric
					mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 3:</h3>
				<p>
					Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed
					butter mixture, alternating with coconut milk, into flour mixture
					until batter is just mixed.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 4:</h3>
				<p>
					Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift
					your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds
					rather than a sharp peak. Fold egg whites into batter. Pour batter
					into the prepared cake pan.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Step 5:</h3>
				<p>
					Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of
					the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
				</p>
			</li>
